# This program simulates the children's game Rock Paper Scissors.  Each contestant selects an item and then reveals choice.
# Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, paper beats rock.  If both make the same choice it is a tie.
# Play continues until 1 play has 3 wins.
# This is derived from: https://github.com/talkpython/100daysofcode-with-python-course/tree/master/days/13-15-text-games
